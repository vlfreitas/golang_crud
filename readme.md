# Crud Golang

## Requirement Install
* [GoLang](https://golang.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test API

## Project Description

* What does the application do?
    - Management of a User CRUD

* Why did I use these technologies?
    - I used Golang because I had no knowledge of the technology. I used the Gin framework, reading a little about the frameworks I saw that it was similar to Django (Python).

* Some of the challenges I faced and features I wanted to implement
    - Understand how language works. Search for frameworks to solve problems and create the application. I was hoping to be able to add Swagger to map the API and also create unit tests. I read about both things but I didn't feel comfortable implementing them due to lack of knowledge.


## Installation

Clone project
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vlfreitas/golang_crud.git
$ cd golang_crud
```
Running the application
```sh
$ go run main.go
```
